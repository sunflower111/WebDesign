  <h2 align=left>Bright Summer Day</h2>
<p>This is part of my <b>summer homework</b> for <i>AP 2D Design</i>. It was part of a study of how different lighting changes the atmosphere of an art piece. This one has the lighting of a sunny day, which makes it cheerful, but peaceful. The hard lighting makes the scene seem brighter.</p>

  This is another part of my <b>summer homework</b> for <i>AP 2D Design</i>. It was part of the same study of how different lighting changes the atmosphere of an art piece. This one has the lighting of a rainy day, which makes it muted, but peaceful. The soft lighting makes it more muted.</p>
